INSTALLATION
============

   You can run the program directly from the unpacked source
directory, by pointing your web browser to the file "index.html".
On a Linux system, most likely the command

    firefox index.html

will work.

   To install webpuzzle on your own web server, make all the files
listed in "puzzle.manifest" available in a web-accessible directory.
Also add the file "puzzle.manifest" itself.  This file will need to be
served by the web server using the content type "text/cache-manifest".
If you are using Apache, adding the following line to the server
configuration should make this work:

    AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest
